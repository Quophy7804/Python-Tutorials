What is XML?
------------
XML = eXtensible Markup Language
It is used to transport, organize and store data.

XML (Extensible Markup Language) is a markup language similar to HTML, but without predefined tags to use.
Instead, you define your own tags designed specifically for your needs.
This is a powerful way to store data in a format that can be stored, searched, and shared.

Advantages of XML
*****************
XML uses human, not computer, language. XML is readable and understandable, even by novices, and no more difficult to code than HTML.
XML is completely compatible with Javaâ„¢ and 100% portable. Any application that can process XML can use your information, regardless of platform.
XML is extendable.
