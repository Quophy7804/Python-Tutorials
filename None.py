'''
NONE
-------------
None is its own object, its equivalent in other languages like java is the null.

Its an immutable keyword, just TRUE and FALSE (boolean keywords)

we use keywords like IS with the none. Don't use '=='; x==None is wrong
'''

x = None

if x is None:
    pass

if x is None:
    pass
